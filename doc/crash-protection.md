# Crash protection

**English** | [简体中文](crash-protection-zh.md)

This document explains how `flutter_patcher` automatically rolls back when a patch goes wrong, and how it prevents the same bad patch from being loaded again.

If a patch causes a boot failure or a serious Dart-level error during early UI, the plugin rolls back to the APK's built-in version on the next cold start and adds the offending patch to a local blacklist.

The whole decision happens on the client without depending on the server.
You should still pair it with staged rollouts, crash monitoring, and a server-side kill switch for production.

---

## Default behavior

The default policy is fail-fast:

> Once a patch is confirmed to fail even once after loading, it is dropped and added to the local blacklist.

On the next cold start the app falls back to the built-in version of the APK.
The plugin does not retry the same patch, to avoid spreading the failure across more users.

Default config:

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.init(
  maxCrashCount: 1,
  verifyAfter: const Duration(seconds: 5),
);
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `maxCrashCount` | `1` | Number of consecutive failures before the patch is tripped. |
| `verifyAfter` | `5 seconds` | Window during which the post-first-frame Dart error hooks keep watching. |

You can raise `maxCrashCount`, but it's rarely a good idea in production.
Once a patch is known to fail boot, retrying typically just amplifies the impact.

## What counts as a failure

The plugin tries to distinguish "the patch broke us" from "the user / system caused a normal exit".

### Counts toward the circuit breaker

The following are treated as patch failures:

- App crashes
- Native crashes
- ANRs
- Serious Dart errors during early launch / first frame
- Dart errors caught by the framework that nonetheless leave the first frame blank or unusable

### Does not count

The following are not treated as patch failures:

- The user swiping the app away from recents
- The user pressing Home to background the app
- The user force-stopping the app from system settings
- The system reclaiming the process under memory pressure
- Non-first-frame exceptions during normal business flow

The signal quality varies across Android versions; see [Android version differences](#android-version-differences).

---

## Boot success window

Whether a patch is "stable" is decided across two phases.

### 1. First-frame render

After the patch loads, if the app reaches the first frame, the boot is treated as initially successful and any in-flight circuit-breaker state is cleared.

This avoids misclassifying as patch failures:

- Pressing Home right after the first frame
- Swiping the app from recents shortly after launch
- The system reclaiming the process in the background

### 2. `verifyAfter` watch window

After the first frame, the Dart error hooks keep watching for `verifyAfter` (default 5 seconds).

The window is meant to catch serious Dart-level failures during the first-screen experience, e.g.:

- Tapping immediately on the first screen triggers an exception
- The framework caught an exception but the page rendered blank
- Critical first-screen logic threw and left the app unusable

`verifyAfter` only accumulates while the app is foregrounded.
After the window closes, business-level errors no longer feed back into the circuit breaker.

---

## Android version differences

Android's signal for "why did the process exit" varies by version.

### Android 11+ (API 30+)

Android 11+ supports `ActivityManager.getHistoricalProcessExitReasons`, which lets `CrashGuard` distinguish:

- Real Dart / framework crashes (`REASON_CRASH`)
- Native crashes (`REASON_CRASH_NATIVE`)
- ANRs (`REASON_ANR`)
- Initialization failures (`REASON_INITIALIZATION_FAILURE`) — e.g. JNI / loader errors before any Dart code runs
- User-initiated stops, low-memory reclaims, and external SIGKILLs (not counted)

Looking up the previous session is keyed by the **pid we recorded on `attachBaseContext`**, which `CrashGuard` deliberately retains across successful boots (`KEY_LAST_BOOTING_PID`). That's what lets the next cold start still attribute a *post-first-frame* native crash to the patch — without it we'd only catch failures before the patch_loading flag was cleared.

### Android 10 and below

Android 10 and below do not have `ApplicationExitInfo`.
`CrashGuard` falls back to the `patch_loading` flag persisted in SharedPreferences to determine "did the previous launch die mid-patch-load".

This means:

- Boot failures *before* the first frame are detected (the flag is still `true`)
- **Known blind spot:** native crashes or ANRs that happen *after* the first frame are not attributable — the flag was already cleared by `markBootSuccess`. The Dart-error hooks still cover this window for Dart-level failures.
- Dart errors inside the `verifyAfter` window are still caught by the error hooks

If your traffic on API < 30 is significant, plug in your existing crash-monitoring system and stop delivering the bad patch from the server side as soon as you see it.

---

## Blacklist

A patch that triggers an automatic rollback is recorded in the local blacklist with the composite key `(version, md5)`.

What this means:

- The same patch will be rejected if delivered again
- If you reuse the same `version` for a new fix, a different MD5 is still allowed
- Manual `rollback()` does **not** add the patch to the blacklist
- The blacklist persists across APK upgrades, in case the server forgets to delisting a known-bad patch

> **Missing md5**: when the server does not ship `md5` (`PatchInfo.md5 == ''`), the
> pre-download blacklist check degrades to a version-only match — any blacklist
> entry sharing this `version` is enough to reject the patch. On the native side
> the entry's `md5` field is filled with the actual md5 computed after download,
> which keeps it useful for triage.

The blacklist uses FIFO eviction with a cap of 50 entries; older records are dropped beyond that.

### Inspect the blacklist

```dart
final entries = await FlutterPatcher.blacklist;

for (final e in entries) {
  print('${e.version} / ${e.md5} / ${e.reason} / ${e.blacklistedAt}');
}
```

### Clear the blacklist

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.clearBlacklist();
```

`clearBlacklist()` is for debugging — don't expose it to ordinary users in production.

## Configuration

Crash-protection settings live in `FlutterPatcher.init()`:

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.init(
  maxCrashCount: 1,
  verifyAfter: const Duration(seconds: 5),
);
```

### `maxCrashCount`

Number of consecutive failures before the patch is tripped and blacklisted.

Default: `1`. This is the recommended production value.

### `verifyAfter`

The window during which the post-first-frame Dart error hooks keep watching.

Default: 5 seconds.
Raise it if your first-screen initialization or interactions are slow; lower it if you only care about the very early window.

---

## Monitoring recommendations

Client-side crash protection is the last line of defense. In production, also monitor and act server-side.

### 1. Report boot diagnostics

After every cold start, read `lastBootDiagnostic` and report any non-healthy state to your analytics backend. The API and field shapes are documented in [API Reference → Boot diagnostics](api-reference.md#boot-diagnostics).

Watch these states in particular:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `droppedCircuitBreaker` | Patch tripped the circuit breaker | Strong alert; stop delivering |
| `droppedSignatureInvalid` | Signature verification failed | Alert; investigate the source |
| `droppedMd5Mismatch` | Local file MD5 does not match the recorded MD5 | Report and investigate |
| `droppedMetaCorrupted` | Patch metadata is corrupt | Report and investigate |
| `hookInstallFailed` | FlutterLoader hook failed to install | Check Flutter version compatibility |

### 2. Server-side automatic delisting

If the same patch produces multiple `droppedCircuitBreaker` events in a short window, the server should automatically stop returning that patch.

Useful dimensions to consider:

- Patch version
- MD5
- Target APK `versionCode`
- ABI
- Device Android version
- App version
- Time window

### 3. Staged rollout

A typical ramp:

```text
1% → 5% → 20% → 50% → 100%
```

Watch crash rate, boot-failure rate, and the key business metrics at each stage.
If anything looks wrong, stop delivering the patch immediately.

### 4. Emergency rollback

An emergency rollback only needs the check-update endpoint to stop returning the bad version.
Devices that already triggered crash protection have rolled back locally and will refuse to load the same problematic patch again.

---

## Debugging

### Logcat

Crash-protection logs use this tag:

```bash
adb logcat | grep FlutterPatcher/Guard
```

### Diagnostic card

`example/lib/diag_card.dart` renders the diagnostic fields as a visual card.

While debugging on a real device you can directly see:

- Current patch state
- The most recent boot diagnostic
- Blacklist entries
- The reason for the most recent rollback

## Circuit-breaker timeline

The state machine lives in [`CrashGuard.kt`](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/CrashGuard.kt) (not `FlutterPatcherApplication`). Keys are SharedPreferences-backed: `KEY_PATCH_LOADING`, `KEY_CRASH_COUNT`, `KEY_LAST_BOOTING_PID`.

| When | What happens |
|---|---|
| `Application.attachBaseContext` | `markBooting()`: write `patch_loading=true` and the current pid (synchronous `commit()`). |
| Dart `FlutterPatcher.init()` | Defensive fallback write of `patch_loading=true` if the native write failed. |
| First frame rendered | `markBootSuccess()`: clear `patch_loading` and `crash_count`. **Keep** `KEY_LAST_BOOTING_PID` so the next cold start can still query ExitInfo for this pid. Start the `verifyAfter` timer. |
| Foreground time accumulates `verifyAfter` | Tear down the Dart-error-hook watch window. |
| Dart error hook fires inside the window | Count one failure and queue a rollback on the next cold start. |
| Next cold start `shouldLoadPatch` | On API 30+ with a known pid, query `getHistoricalProcessExitReasons` for the precise exit reason. Otherwise fall back to `patch_loading`. |
| `crash_count >= maxCrashCount` | Delete the patch directory, add to the blacklist, fall back to the APK's built-in version. |

## Mapping `ApplicationExitInfo` (Android 11+)

On Android 11+, `CrashGuard` looks up the previous session's exit reason and counts only the four crash-like categories:

| reason | Counts as crash |
|---|---|
| `REASON_CRASH` | Yes |
| `REASON_CRASH_NATIVE` | Yes |
| `REASON_ANR` | Yes |
| `REASON_INITIALIZATION_FAILURE` | Yes |
| `REASON_USER_REQUESTED` | No |
| `REASON_USER_STOPPED` | No |
| `REASON_LOW_MEMORY` | No |
| `REASON_OTHER` | No |
| `REASON_SIGNALED`, e.g. SIGKILL | No |

## Dart-side blank-screen safety net

A bad patch doesn't always crash the process. A Dart-level `throw` caught by the framework can leave the process alive but the screen blank or unusable.

To handle that, `init()` installs **Flutter-level** error hooks during the `verifyAfter` window:

- `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError`
- `FlutterError.onError`

Either firing inside the window counts as one patch failure and queues a rollback on disk.

> Note: the plugin does **not** install Android's `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler`. Native (JNI / `.so`) crashes are caught indirectly on the *next* cold start via `ApplicationExitInfo` (API 30+) or the `patch_loading` fallback (API < 30). Recovery is always cross-process; the current process has already loaded the patched `.so` and cannot revert without a restart.

After the window closes, both hooks still forward transparently to any prior handler but stop reporting circuit-breaker events to the native side.
