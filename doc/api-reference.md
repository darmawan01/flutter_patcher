# API Reference

**English** | [简体中文](api-reference-zh.md)

Every public API in `flutter_patcher` is exposed as a static member on the `FlutterPatcher` class.

The plugin only executes patch logic on Android.
On iOS, Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux, calling these APIs is a no-op — they don't throw, they print a one-time warning on first call, and they return safe defaults.

---

## Initialization

Call before `runApp()`:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await FlutterPatcher.init();

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

Most projects need no parameters. `init()` prepares the patch loader, the crash-protection state machine, and the boot diagnostic recorder. Repeated calls are safe.

If you want to enable signature verification, change the circuit-breaker threshold, or work around an unusual Flutter build, override the defaults:

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.init(
  publicKeyBase64: 'MFkwEwYH...==',
  maxCrashCount: 1,
  strictSignature: true,
  loaderFieldCandidates: ['flutterLoader'],
  loaderFallbackHeuristic: false,
  verifyAfter: const Duration(seconds: 5),
);
```

| Parameter | Description |
| ---  | --- |
| `publicKeyBase64` | Ed25519 public key. When `PatchInfo.signature` is empty, signature verification is skipped. A patch that ships with a signature but is loaded on a client without a configured public key is rejected. |
| `maxCrashCount` | Number of consecutive crashes that trips the patch. Default `1`. |
| `strictSignature` | On API < 33 (no JDK Ed25519 support), reject signed patches instead of silently skipping verification. On API ≥ 33 the flag has no effect — native verification always runs. |
| `loaderFieldCandidates` | Candidate field names used to locate `FlutterLoader`. Rarely needs changing. |
| `loaderFallbackHeuristic` | If the candidates fail, use a heuristic last-resort scan. Off by default. |
| `verifyAfter` | Window after launch during which the patch is still considered "under verification". |

---

## Check for updates (optional)

> The plugin ships a minimal, optional check-update JSON protocol intended for quick onboarding, the example, and local debugging. In production you almost certainly already have your own update / staging / auth protocol — parse the response yourself, build a `PatchInfo`, and skip this section.

If you do want to use the built-in protocol, call `checkUpdate`:

```dart
try {
  final check = await FlutterPatcher.checkUpdate(
    'https://api.example.com/patch/check',
    headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $token'},
    timeout: const Duration(seconds: 10),
  );

  if (check.hasUpdate) {
    await FlutterPatcher.applyPatch(check.patch!);
  }
} on PatcherException catch (e) {
  log.warning('check update failed: ${e.message}');
}
```

`checkUpdate` returns a `PatchCheckResult`:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hasUpdate` | `bool` | Whether a patch is available. |
| `patch` | `PatchInfo?` | The patch info; `null` when no update is available. |

If your server already speaks its own update protocol, skip `checkUpdate` and build a `PatchInfo` directly before calling `applyPatch`.

---

## Apply a patch

There are two ways to apply a patch:

* `applyPatch`: pass a URL and let the plugin download and verify it (recommended for most apps).
* `applyPatchBytes`: pass the patch bytes directly — useful for custom downloaders, asset-bundled patches, or isolate-based loading.

A successful apply takes effect on the **next cold start**. The current process is never modified in place.

### Option 1: let the plugin download the patch

```dart
final result = await FlutterPatcher.applyPatch(
  PatchInfo(
    version: '1.0.0-h1',
    patchUrl: 'https://cdn.example.com/libapp.so',
    md5: '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef',
    targetVersionCode: 100,
  ),
  onProgress: (p) {
    print('${p.phase.name}: ${p.fraction ?? "..."}');
  },
);

if (result.ok) {
  showRestartHint();
}
```

`targetVersionCode` is the host APK `versionCode` the patch was built for — **not** the patch version. If your live APK is `versionCode = 100`, every patch built for that APK should set `targetVersionCode: 100`.

If multiple APK versions are live at the same time, build and ship a separate patch per `versionCode`.

### Option 2: apply patch bytes directly

```dart
final bytes = await loadPatchFromYourSource();

final result = await FlutterPatcher.applyPatchBytes(
  bytes,
  version: '1.0.0-h1',
  targetVersionCode: 100,
  onProgress: (p) => print(p.phase.name),
);
```

`applyPatchBytes` automatically computes the MD5, manages the temporary file, and reuses the same flow as `applyPatch`.

---

## Handle the result

Both `applyPatch` and `applyPatchBytes` return a `PatchApplyResult`:

```dart
if (result.ok) {
  // Patch persisted; takes effect on the next cold start.
  showRestartHint();
} else {
  switch (result.error!) {
    case PatchApplyError.blacklisted:
      // This patch previously caused a crash; stop delivering it.
      break;

    case PatchApplyError.network:
    case PatchApplyError.ioError:
      // Transient — retry later.
      break;

    case PatchApplyError.md5Mismatch:
      // CDN content or server-side md5 may be inconsistent.
      break;

    case PatchApplyError.signatureInvalid:
      // Treat as a security event.
      break;

    default:
      log.warning('patch failed: ${result.error?.name} / ${result.message}');
  }
}
```

`result.message` is for developers — don't surface it to end users.

Re-applying the same patch is safe; if it is already installed, the call returns `ok = true`.

---

## Error codes

| Code | Meaning | Suggested handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invalidArgs` | Missing or malformed arguments | Inspect the server response |
| `blacklisted` | Patch hit the local blacklist | Stop delivering this patch |
| `network` | Download failed | Retry later |
| `md5Mismatch` | Downloaded MD5 does not match (only triggered when md5 is provided) | Check CDN / server-side md5 |
| `signatureInvalid` | Signature verification failed | Treat as a security event; do not retry |
| `unsupportedAbi` | The `patch.zip` has no `libapp.so` for the device's ABI | Ship per-ABI patches or filter server-side |
| `assetPackageInvalid` | `patch.zip` contents are malformed or stale (bad schema, unsafe path, overlay file missing inside the ZIP, base APK's Flutter asset table couldn't be read, unsupported op) | Rebuild the release APK on the same Flutter toolchain, then re-pack with the current `pack` CLI; see [Asset Patching](#asset-patching) |
| `ioError` | Disk write, rename, or permission failure | Retry later |
| `unknown` | Unclassified error | Inspect `result.message` |

---

## Listening to progress

Besides `onProgress`, you can subscribe to the global broadcast stream:

```dart
FlutterPatcher.applyProgress.listen((p) {
  print('${p.phase.name}: ${p.fraction}');
});
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `phase` | Current phase: `downloading`, `verifying`, `finalizing`. |
| `bytesReceived` | Bytes received so far; only meaningful while downloading. |
| `totalBytes` | Total bytes; `-1` when the server omits `Content-Length`. |
| `fraction` | Download progress in `0.0 ~ 1.0`; `null` when unknown. |

---

## Roll back

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.rollback();
```

Rollback deletes the current patch. On the next cold start the app falls back to the version baked into the APK.

A manual rollback does **not** add the patch to the blacklist.

---

## Manually report a successful boot

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.reportBootSuccess();
```

You usually don't need to call this. `init()` automatically reports a successful boot once the first frame has rendered.

Call it explicitly only when you want to confirm the patch is healthy with custom logic before the first frame:

```dart
await runLightweightSelfCheck();
await FlutterPatcher.reportBootSuccess();
```

Once the first frame has rendered, additional calls are no-ops.

---

## Query state

```dart
final int? code = await FlutterPatcher.appVersionCode;
final String? version = await FlutterPatcher.currentVersion;
final String abi = await FlutterPatcher.deviceAbi;
```

| API | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `appVersionCode` | The current APK's `versionCode`. Uses `longVersionCode` on API 28+. |
| `currentVersion` | The patch version currently on disk (read from `meta.json`). Becomes readable immediately after a successful `applyPatch`, but the Flutter Engine only loads it on the next cold start. `null` when there is no patch. |
| `deviceAbi` | The current device ABI; useful for check-update requests. |

---

## Boot diagnostics

After every cold start the native side records a single patch-load result. Read it via `lastBootDiagnostic` and report it:

```dart
final diag = await FlutterPatcher.lastBootDiagnostic;

if (diag != null && !diag.isHealthy) {
  analytics.report('patch_dropped', {
    'status': diag.status.name,
    'patch_version': diag.patchVersion,
    'crash_count': diag.crashCount,
    'message': diag.message,
  });
}
```

`PatchBootDiagnostic` fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `PatchBootStatus` | The boot result. |
| `recordedAt` | `DateTime` | When the diagnostic was recorded. |
| `patchVersion` | `String?` | The patch version involved. |
| `patchTargetVersionCode` | `int?` | The `versionCode` the patch was built for. |
| `appVersionCode` | `int?` | The current APK's `versionCode`. |
| `crashCount` | `int?` | Cumulative crash count. |
| `attemptedLoaderFields` | `List<String>?` | Field names tried when the loader hook failed. |
| `message` | `String?` | Developer-facing diagnostic text. |
| `isHealthy` | `bool` | `true` when the status is `patched` or `noPatch`. |

`PatchBootStatus` values:

| Value | Meaning | Suggested handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `patched` | Patch loaded successfully | Normal |
| `noPatch` | No patch; running APK built-in version | Normal |
| `droppedVersionCodeMismatch` | APK was upgraded; the old patch is no longer valid | Usually no alert needed |
| `droppedCircuitBreaker` | Patch caused repeated crashes and was tripped | Strong alert; stop delivering |
| `droppedSignatureInvalid` | Signature verification failed | Alert; investigate the source |
| `droppedMd5Mismatch` | Local file MD5 does not match the recorded MD5 | Report and investigate |
| `droppedMetaCorrupted` | Patch metadata is corrupt | Report and investigate |
| `hookInstallFailed` | FlutterLoader hook failed to install | Check Flutter version / `loaderFieldCandidates` |
| `unknown` | Unclassified error | Inspect `message` |

For interactive debugging, see `example/lib/diag_card.dart` — it renders the diagnostic on-device.

---

## Blacklist

When a patch causes a boot crash or a verification failure, the plugin adds it to a local blacklist so the same bad patch is not retried.

```dart
final entries = await FlutterPatcher.blacklist;

for (final e in entries) {
  print('${e.version} / ${e.md5} / ${e.reason} / ${e.blacklistedAt}');
}
```

To clear the blacklist (debug only):

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.clearBlacklist();
```

`BlacklistEntry` fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | `String` | Patch version. |
| `md5` | `String` | Patch file MD5. |
| `reason` | `String` | Why the patch was blacklisted. |
| `blacklistedAt` | `DateTime` | When the entry was recorded. |

Common `reason` values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `BOOT_CRASH` | Patch caused a boot crash. |
| `MD5_MISMATCH` | MD5 verification failed. |
| `SIGNATURE_INVALID` | Signature verification failed. |

---

## PatchInfo

`PatchInfo` describes a patch ready to apply.

```dart
final patch = PatchInfo(
  version: '1.0.0-h1',
  patchUrl: 'https://cdn.example.com/libapp.so',
  md5: '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef',
  targetVersionCode: 100,
);
```

You can also build it from a server response:

```dart
final patch = PatchInfo.fromJson(json);
final map = patch.toJson();
```

`fromJson` accepts both camelCase and snake_case field names; unknown fields are kept in `raw`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | `String` | Yes | Patch identifier, an arbitrary string. |
| `patchUrl` | `String` | Yes | Patch download URL. |
| `md5` | `String` | No | Patch MD5 (lower-case 32-hex). An empty string skips MD5 verification (and signature verification along with it). |
| `signature` | `String` | No | Ed25519 signature, base64. Empty disables signature verification. Only effective when `md5` is non-empty. |
| `targetVersionCode` | `int?` | Recommended | Host APK `versionCode` the patch is built for. |
| `raw` | `Map<String, dynamic>` | No | Original fields preserved by `fromJson`. |

---

## Exception behavior

Only `checkUpdate` throws `PatcherException`, typically for network failures or unparsable JSON.

Every other API reports outcomes through return values rather than exceptions.

```dart
try {
  final check = await FlutterPatcher.checkUpdate(url);
} on PatcherException catch (e) {
  log.warning(e.message);
}
```

---

## pack CLI

`flutter_patcher:pack` extracts `libapp.so` (and, optionally, Flutter asset overlays) from a release APK and emits the patch metadata.

```bash
dart run flutter_patcher:pack \
  --apk build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk \
  --version 1.0.0-h1 \
  --target-version-code 100
```

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--apk <path>` | Required. Path to the release APK. |
| `--version <string>` | Required. Patch identifier. |
| `--target-version-code <int>` | Required. Host APK `versionCode` the patch targets. |
| `--abi <string>` | Optional. Defaults to the first match among `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`. |
| `--assets <KEY[,KEY...]>` | Optional. Comma-separated Flutter asset keys to overlay. Use `@path/to/list.txt` to read keys from a UTF-8 file (one per line, `#` starts a comment). Inline keys and `@file` references can be mixed, e.g. `--assets @list.txt,assets/extra.png`. See [Asset Patching](#asset-patching). |
| `--out <dir>` | Optional. Output directory; defaults to `dist/`. |

`--target-version-code` binds the patch to a specific base APK already installed on the user's device. For example:

* The live APK is `versionCode = 100`
* You are publishing patch `1.0.0-h1` for that APK
* `--target-version-code` should be `100`

If the APK is upgraded to a new `versionCode`, old patches expire automatically.
If multiple `versionCode`s are live at the same time, build and ship a separate patch per base.

Output (always `schemaVersion: 2`, `payload: patch.zip`):

```text
dist/
├── patch.zip
└── manifest.json
```

Upload both files to your CDN and return `manifest.json` from your update endpoint. The plugin reads `manifest.payload` and downloads `patch.zip`. A `patch.zip` packed without `--assets` contains only `manifest.json` + `lib/<abi>/libapp.so` (the inner manifest omits the `assets` block); with `--assets` it additionally embeds `manifest_patch.json` and per-key overlay files. See [Asset Patching](#asset-patching).

---

## Asset Patching

Since 0.1.3, Flutter assets (images, fonts, JSON, etc.) can be hot-patched together with Dart code via the v2 `patch.zip` payload. Call sites don't change — `Image.asset('assets/hero.png')` and `rootBundle.load('assets/strings/zh.json')` keep working; the patch overlays new bytes under the same keys on the next cold start.

### Workflow

1. Rebuild a release APK with the changed assets (and any Dart code that references them) declared in `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Pack with `--assets` listing the asset keys to overlay:

   ```bash
   dart run flutter_patcher:pack \
     --apk path/to/patched-release.apk \
     --version 1.0.1 \
     --target-version-code 2 \
     --assets assets/hero.png,assets/strings/zh.json
   ```

   For long key lists, point `--assets` at a text file with `@` (one key per line, `#` for comments). Inline keys and `@file` can be mixed in the same flag:

   ```bash
   dart run flutter_patcher:pack \
     --apk path/to/patched-release.apk \
     --version 1.0.1 \
     --target-version-code 2 \
     --assets @patch-assets.txt,assets/last-minute.png
   ```

3. Ship `dist/patch.zip` from your CDN. `dist/manifest.json` is a sidecar that tells **your update backend** the version, MD5, target `versionCode`, and which file is the payload (`payload: patch.zip`). The plugin itself only sees what your backend hands it inside `PatchInfo` — make sure `PatchInfo.patchUrl` points at the hosted `patch.zip`.

### Payload layout (`patch.zip`, v2)

```text
manifest.json          # inner manifest, schemaVersion 2 (lib map + optional assets block)
manifest_patch.json    # asset-table delta operations (only present when assets are packed)
lib/<abi>/libapp.so    # patched Dart code (always present)
assets/<asset-path>    # overlay bytes, one entry per requested path (and per resolution variant)
```

A Dart-only `patch.zip` (no `--assets`) contains only the first and third entries; the inner manifest omits the `assets` block and `manifest_patch.json` is absent.

The outer `manifest.json` (consumed by `mock_server` for local testing and by your own backend in production) carries `schemaVersion`, `version`, `targetVersionCode`, `abi`, `payload: patch.zip`, and the package-payload MD5. The inner `manifest.json` (inside the ZIP) lists per-file MD5s for `libapp.so` and every overlay file. The plugin only consumes the inner one; the outer one never reaches the device by itself.

### `manifest_patch.json` schema

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "manifestFormat": "bin",
  "baseManifestSize": 322,
  "operations": [
    {
      "op": "upsert",
      "key": "assets/hero.png",
      "variants": [
        { "asset": "assets/hero.png" },
        { "asset": "assets/2.0x/hero.png" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `op` | Currently only `upsert` is supported. |
| `key` | Flutter asset path as registered under `assets:` in `pubspec.yaml`. |
| `variants` | Resolution-aware variants (`1.0x`, `2.0x`, etc.) auto-discovered from the patched APK's Flutter asset table. |

During install (not cold start) the runtime merges these operations into the APK's baseline asset table, writes the merged table plus overlay files into the patch's private directory, and packages the result as a private `flutter_assets.apk`. At cold start [`LoaderHook`](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/LoaderHook.kt) installs a patched `FlutterLoader` + `FlutterJNI` AssetManager that resolves Flutter asset reads to the patched directory; APK fallback still works for paths the patch didn't touch.

### Asset path requirements

* Every path passed to `--assets` must already be declared under `assets:` in the **patched APK's** `pubspec.yaml`. `pack` looks each path up against the APK's Flutter asset table; paths that Flutter didn't compile into the APK produce an error.
* You can add brand-new assets via a patch as long as you declare them in `pubspec.yaml`, ship a new release APK that contains them, and then pack against that APK.
* You **cannot remove** an asset that exists in the base APK — the overlay only replaces bytes under an existing path.
* The on-device asset bundle resolves variants the standard Flutter way; you don't need to enumerate every `2.0x/`, `3.0x/`, etc. — the packer expands them automatically.

### ABI handling

A single `patch.zip` carries `libapp.so` for **one** ABI. The plugin rejects mismatches with `unsupportedAbi`. Either:

* pack one ZIP per ABI (`--abi arm64-v8a`, `--abi armeabi-v7a`, ...) and route by `deviceAbi` server-side, or
* if your app ships only `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`, accept the small per-ABI distribution cost.

### Validation errors

The plugin returns `assetPackageInvalid` when the ZIP fails any of these checks at install time:

* Inner `schemaVersion` unknown
* Unsupported asset `mode` (only `overlay` is recognized)
* Unsafe entry path inside the ZIP (absolute, contains `..`, or NUL byte)
* The base APK is missing the Flutter asset table that the overlay needs to merge against (rebuild the APK on the same Flutter toolchain)
* An overlay file declared in the inner manifest is missing from the ZIP
* Per-file MD5 mismatch between the inner manifest and the actual bytes

### Security

The outer MD5 / signature in the server's update response cover the whole `patch.zip`. Inner per-file MD5s are integrity checks during extraction, not a separate security surface — keep the outer signature mandatory in production.

### When work happens

`applyPatch` does the heavy lifting; cold start just validates and loads. Concretely:

**During `applyPatch` (install time):**

1. Download `patch.zip` to a temp file; verify outer MD5 + Ed25519 signature against the value carried in `PatchInfo`.
2. Open the ZIP, validate inner `schemaVersion` and per-file MD5s.
3. Extract `lib/<abi>/libapp.so` to staging.
4. If the patch carries assets: copy the APK's `flutter_assets/` to staging, overlay each path listed in the inner manifest, merge the overlay operations into the asset table, and pack the result into a private `flutter_assets.apk`.
5. Atomically commit the staged artifacts to `current/` (see [Architecture → Atomic install](architecture.md#atomic-install)).

**On the next cold start:**

1. Verify `current/` matches the host APK's `versionCode` and that the on-disk `libapp.so` still matches its meta MD5.
2. [`LoaderHook`](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/LoaderHook.kt) installs a patched `FlutterLoader` + `FlutterJNI` AssetManager that points Flutter at the patched `libapp.so` and (if assets are present) at the private `flutter_assets.apk`.

If validation fails, or the in-process crash guard trips, the patch is dropped and the next cold start falls back to the APK's built-in version.

## Performance and supported range

### Performance impact

| Metric | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| APK size delta | ~80–120 KB |
| Cold-start delta | ~5–15 ms |
| Runtime memory | No additional resident footprint after patch load |
| Patch file size | Typically 5–15 MB |

> Numbers measured on Pixel 6 / Flutter 3.24. Real-world results vary with device, Flutter version, and build configuration.

### Supported range

| Dimension | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | Android |
| Android `minSdk` | 24 |
| Flutter | `>=3.3.0`; loader hook verified on 3.19 ~ 3.38 |
| ABI | `armeabi-v7a` / `arm64-v8a` / `x86_64` |
| NDK | 27.0.12077973+ |
| AGP | 8.11.1+ |
| Kotlin | 2.2.20+ |
| Java / JVM | 17 |

On non-Android platforms every API is a no-op: a one-time warning is logged and safe defaults are returned. No exceptions are thrown.

---

## Version compatibility

* During the `0.x` series the API may still change; pin a version in `pubspec.yaml`.
* `PatchBootStatus` and blacklist `reason` values are forward-compatible: new values are mapped to `unknown` by older SDKs.
* `PatchInfo.fromJson` accepts both camelCase and snake_case names; unknown fields are preserved in `raw` and don't break parsing.
