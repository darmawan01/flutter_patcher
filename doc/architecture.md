# Architecture

**English** | [简体中文](architecture-zh.md)

This document covers how `flutter_patcher` works, the self-hosted server protocol, and a small number of advanced configuration options.

If you only want to integrate quickly, read the API reference first. This document is more useful when:

- You want to understand why a patch only takes effect on the next cold start
- You need to self-host the patch check / distribution service
- You need to evaluate security, compatibility, or app-store compliance
- Your Android project has an unusual startup, such as eagerly preheating `FlutterEngine`

## How it works

### Overview

A `flutter_patcher` rollout involves three actors: the developer machine, the server, and the user device.

```text
  Dev machine                Server                   User device
─────────────              ─────────────              ─────────────
 Edit Dart / assets        Storage + delivery         Download + verify
      │                          │                           │
 flutter build apk           Upload payload              applyPatch()
      │                 libapp.so or patch.zip               │
 pack extracts payload            │                    Atomic stage on disk
      │                          │                           │
      └──────────────→     CDN / object store    ──────────→ Load on next cold start
                                                              │
                                                       Boot OK   → keep patch
                                                       Boot fail → auto-rollback
```

Since 0.1.3 the producer always emits `patch.zip` (a Dart-only patch is just a `patch.zip` without an `assets` block). The on-device runtime also accepts the bare `libapp.so` payloads produced by 0.1.0–0.1.2 to keep older patches loading, but this is a quiet compat path — new patches should be `patch.zip`. The plugin never swaps code inside a running process; patches take effect on the next cold start.

---

### Patch lifecycle

On a user device a patch goes through:

```text
applyPatch (install phase)
  ↓
Download patch.zip → verify outer MD5 + signature
  ↓
Extract lib/<abi>/libapp.so to staging; for asset patches also
  copy APK flutter_assets/ → overlay paths → merge asset table
  → package the result as a private flutter_assets.apk
  ↓
Atomic commit: rename staging artifacts → current/
  ↓
…wait for the next cold start…
  ↓
Cold start: validate current/ (versionCode + MD5 of installed libapp.so)
  ↓
LoaderHook redirects Flutter to the patched libapp.so
  (and to flutter_assets.apk if assets are present)
  ↓
Boot succeeds: keep using the patch
Boot fails:    auto-rollback on next start
```

The bulk of the work (decryption-free integrity checks, asset overlay synthesis, asset-table merge, private archive packaging) happens during `applyPatch` and is committed to `current/` atomically before the call returns. Cold start only re-validates what's on disk and installs the loader hook; it never reopens the ZIP or re-runs the overlay merge.

Validation order at install (per [PatchManager.kt:303-446](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/PatchManager.kt#L303-L446)): payload MD5 → Ed25519 signature → `versionCode` match (against the inner package manifest) → per-file integrity inside the ZIP. Signature is only checked when `md5` is present (the signed message is the md5 hex string).

At cold start the plugin re-verifies that the on-disk artifacts still belong to this APK (`versionCode` and stored MD5) before loading them. If the patch is invalid, corrupt, mismatched, or blacklisted, the plugin drops it and falls back to the APK's built-in version.

For the full crash-protection decision flow, Android-version differences, and blacklist behavior, see [Crash protection](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_patcher/latest/topics/Crash-protection-topic.html).

---

### VersionCode binding

Each patch is bound to one host APK `versionCode`.

On cold start, if the current APK's `versionCode` does not match the patch's `targetVersionCode`, the plugin drops the patch.

This guards against:

- Loading an old patch after the user upgraded the APK
- Server-side mistakes that ship a patch built for an old APK to a newer build
- Sharing one patch between incompatible production versions

That's why building a patch must explicitly name the base APK's `versionCode`:

```bash
dart run flutter_patcher:pack \
  --apk build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk \
  --version 1.0.0-h1 \
  --target-version-code 100
```

`--target-version-code 100` means:

> This patch is only valid for the APK with `versionCode = 100` already installed on the user's device.

If multiple `versionCode`s are live at once, build and ship a separate patch for each base.

---

### Crash safety

`flutter_patcher` is fail-fast by default.
If a patch causes a boot failure, or a serious Dart-level error fires during early UI, the plugin rolls back to the APK's built-in version on the next cold start and prevents the same bad patch from being loaded again.

Production deployments should still combine this with server-side monitoring and staged rollouts.
For the full mechanism, see [Crash protection](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_patcher/latest/topics/Crash-protection-topic.html).

---

### Payload v2 (`patch.zip`)

The `pack` CLI in 0.1.3+ always produces a `patch.zip` (`schemaVersion: 2`). Bare-`libapp.so` payloads built by 0.1.0–0.1.2 are still accepted on device for installed-base compatibility, but no documented producer emits them — assume new patches are always `patch.zip`.

Inside a `patch.zip`:

```text
manifest.json          # schemaVersion 2; lib map + optional assets block
manifest_patch.json    # asset-table delta operations (only when assets are packed)
lib/<abi>/libapp.so    # patched Dart code (always present)
assets/<asset-path>    # one entry per requested path + per resolution variant
```

A Dart-only `patch.zip` contains only the inner `manifest.json` and `lib/<abi>/libapp.so`; the runtime detects the missing `assets` block and skips asset synthesis entirely. See the [API reference → Asset Patching](api-reference.md#asset-patching) for the full schema and validation rules.

---

### Atomic install

Patch installs are crash-safe. The install path ([PatchManager.kt:482-615](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/PatchManager.kt#L482-L615), `finalizePatch` at [L622-767](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/PatchManager.kt#L622-L767)) writes everything in a side directory first, then commits with a sequence of renames:

```text
staging/      ← extract libapp.so; synthesize flutter_assets/ + flutter_assets.apk
   ↓ renames (one per artifact: so, meta, assets dir, assets.apk)
pending/      ← short-lived intermediate; lives only inside finalizePatch
   ↓ rename (the actual commit) — touches an install marker first
current/      ← what the next cold start loads; previous version moves to previous/
   ↓ end of finalizePatch
previous/     ← garbage-collected as part of the same commit
```

`pending/` is **not** "waiting for first successful boot" — it's the temporary rename target inside `finalizePatch`. Once `applyPatch` returns successfully, `current/` is already promoted and `previous/` has been cleaned up. The "first successful boot" gate is the *crash guard* (see [Crash protection](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_patcher/latest/topics/Crash-protection-topic.html)) which deletes `current/` on the next boot if the previous boot tripped the breaker — that's a separate mechanism from the on-disk transaction.

A power-loss or kill mid-install can leave any of `pending/` or `previous/` around with an install marker; on next boot, `recoverInterruptedInstall` ([PatchManager.kt:1146-1172](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/PatchManager.kt#L1146-L1172)) reconciles them by completing the rollback to `previous/` or discarding the half-installed payload.

---

### Asset overlay synthesis (install phase)

When a patch carries asset overlays, the plugin produces a self-contained, Flutter-readable asset bundle during install. The flow ([PatchManager.kt:482-615](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/PatchManager.kt#L482-L615), [L848-983](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/PatchManager.kt#L848-L983)):

1. Copy the base APK's `assets/flutter_assets/*` to a staging directory.
2. Overlay each path listed in the inner manifest with the bytes packed inside `patch.zip`.
3. Decode the baseline asset table with `StandardMessageCodec`, apply each `upsert` from `manifest_patch.json` (replace or insert the variants list), and re-encode it.
4. Verify per-file MD5s against the inner manifest.
5. Re-zip the staging tree into a private `flutter_assets.apk`, stored alongside the patched `libapp.so`.

Cold start does none of the above. It just walks `current/`, verifies that `libapp.so` + `flutter_assets.apk` (if present) match their stored MD5s, and lets the loader hook do its thing:

[`LoaderHook`](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/LoaderHook.kt) intercepts `FlutterLoader.findAppBundlePath` to point at the patched `libapp.so`, and (when assets are present) installs a patched `FlutterJNI` AssetManager that opens the private `flutter_assets.apk`. APK fallback still works for paths the patch didn't touch.

`Image.asset(...)`, `rootBundle.load(...)`, and font lookups go through the redirected bundle automatically — no app-side code changes needed.

---

### Download retry policy

The runtime retries failed HTTP downloads up to **3 times** with exponential backoff (~2s, 4s, 8s — see [PatchManager.kt:355-405](../android/src/main/kotlin/com/flutter_patcher/flutter_patcher/PatchManager.kt#L355-L405)). After the final failure the apply result is `network`. Servers can rely on this without their own client-side retry layer; if you want jitter or different bounds, wrap `applyPatch` in your own backoff loop.

---

### ABI fallback

`libapp.so` is not portable across ABIs. The pack CLI's `--abi` flag controls which one ends up in the patch:

* A `patch.zip` carries **one** `lib/<abi>/libapp.so` entry. The plugin reads `Build.SUPPORTED_ABIS` in priority order and accepts the first matching entry; mismatches return `unsupportedAbi`.
* (Legacy: 0.1.0–0.1.2 bare-`.so` payloads carried one ABI per patch; the server picked the URL by `deviceAbi`. The on-device compat path still accepts these.)

There is no on-device fallback across ABIs — your server is responsible for selecting the right artifact.

---

### `file://` URL support

`PatchInfo.patchUrl` accepts `file://` schemes in addition to `http(s)://`. The plugin reads the local file directly (no network), validates MD5 / signature exactly like a remote payload, and installs it. This powers two flows:

* **Bundled preload patches** — ship a `patch.zip` inside `assets/`, copy it to a cache dir, and call `applyPatch` with a `file://` URL. The example app demonstrates this with `applyPatchBytes` (which is equivalent and skips the file copy).
* **Local mock-server testing** — pointing `patchUrl` at a `file://` URL bypasses HTTP entirely; useful in unit tests and offline CI.

---

## Self-hosting

`flutter_patcher` is not coupled to any particular backend. You can use your own server, CDN, or object storage to distribute patches.

The client only needs a `PatchInfo`; pass it to `applyPatch`.

---

### Check-update protocol (optional)

> The plugin ships a minimal, optional check-update JSON protocol, intended for quick onboarding, the example, and local testing. In production, if you already have your own update / staging / auth protocol, parse the response yourself and build a `PatchInfo` directly — you don't need to follow the format below. What follows is a reference implementation of the minimal protocol.

The client polls the server for new patches.

Sample request:

```http
GET /api/patch/check?app_version_code=100&abi=arm64-v8a&current_patch=1.0.0-h1
```

Recommended parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `app_version_code` | The current APK's `versionCode`. |
| `abi` | Current device ABI, e.g. `arm64-v8a`. |
| `current_patch` | Currently applied patch version; can be empty when no patch is installed. |

When no patch is available:

```json
{
  "has_update": false
}
```

When a patch is available:

```json
{
  "has_update": true,
  "version": "1.0.0-h2",
  "patch_url": "https://cdn.example.com/patches/arm64-v8a/libapp.so",
  "md5": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "target_version_code": 100
}
```

Field names accept both `snake_case` (shown above) and `camelCase` (`patchUrl`, `targetVersionCode`, `hasUpdate`). Servers can pick whichever matches their existing API style — see [PatchInfo.fromJson](../lib/src/patch_info.dart#L58).

If signature verification is enabled, also include `signature`:

```json
{
  "has_update": true,
  "version": "1.0.0-h2",
  "patch_url": "https://cdn.example.com/patches/arm64-v8a/libapp.so",
  "md5": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "target_version_code": 100,
  "signature": "BASE64_SIGNATURE"
}
```

---

### Hosting the patch file

Any HTTP `GET`-able location works.

Common choices:

- A CDN
- Object storage
- An nginx static directory
- Your own file server

Use HTTPS, and make sure the server returns the correct content and a sensible cache policy.

---

### ABI routing

`libapp.so` is not portable across ABIs.

The server must distribute the right binary per ABI:

```text
patches/
├── arm64-v8a/
│   └── libapp.so
├── armeabi-v7a/
│   └── libapp.so
└── x86_64/
    └── libapp.so
```

The client can read the current device ABI:

```dart
final abi = await FlutterPatcher.deviceAbi;
```

Pass it in the check-update request and have the server return the matching URL.

---

### Patch signing

`flutter_patcher` supports Ed25519 signature verification.

Signing provides extra integrity protection beyond HTTPS, in case the CDN or an intermediate hop ever returns a tampered file.

The basic workflow:

1. The client configures the public key in `FlutterPatcher.init()`.
2. The server holds the private key.
3. For every release with signature verification enabled, the server signs the patch MD5.
4. The client verifies MD5 first, then the signature. If `md5` is omitted, both checks are skipped by design.

Configure the public key:

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.init(
  publicKeyBase64: 'MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...',
);
```

Generate a key pair:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out patch_sk.pem
openssl pkey -in patch_sk.pem -pubout -outform DER | base64 -w0
```

Where:

- `patch_sk.pem` is the private key — keep it on the server or build environment only
- The Base64 string from the second command is the public key — embed that in the client

Sign the patch MD5:

```bash
printf "%s" "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" | \
  openssl pkeyutl -sign -inkey patch_sk.pem -rawin | base64 -w0
```

Put the resulting signature in the `signature` field of the check-update response.

---

### strictSignature

`strictSignature` defaults to `true`.

On Android API < 33 (no JDK Ed25519), if the device receives a signed patch, the plugin **rejects** it instead of silently skipping verification. On API ≥ 33 the flag has no effect — native verification always runs.

This avoids the false sense of security where "we configured signing but some devices don't actually verify".

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.init(
  publicKeyBase64: 'MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...',
  strictSignature: true,
);
```

If you explicitly accept that older devices fall back to MD5 + HTTPS only, set:

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.init(
  publicKeyBase64: 'MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...',
  strictSignature: false,
);
```

#### Skipping MD5 entirely (optional)

If your server protocol does not ship `md5` (relying on HTTPS for integrity), leave `PatchInfo.md5` empty:

```dart
PatchInfo(version: 'fix-1', patchUrl: 'https://...', targetVersionCode: 100);
```

In that case **both download integrity and signature verification are skipped** (the Ed25519 input is the md5 hex string — without md5 there is no message to sign over). To keep signature verification, you must ship md5. The native side still computes the actual md5 after download and writes it to `meta.effectiveMd5`, so runtime checks (boot validation and the blacklist) keep a stable key.

---

### Recommended backend practices

- **Stage the rollout.** A typical ramp is `1% → 5% → 20% → 50% → 100%`; watch crash rate, boot-failure rate, and key business metrics between steps.
- **Wire crash reporting to `lastBootDiagnostic`.** Report abnormal states (see [Crash protection](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_patcher/latest/topics/Crash-protection-topic.html)); auto-stop delivery if the same patch trips multiple rollbacks in a short window.
- **Emergency rollback is server-side.** Stop returning the patch from the check-update endpoint — new users won't download it, and devices that already tripped crash protection refuse to reload it. No remote-delete RPC is needed.
- **Keep release records.** For every patch, persist: `version`, `targetVersionCode`, ABI, MD5/signature (if shipped), release time, rollout %, and lifecycle state (ramping / full / rolled back). This is what makes incident triage tractable.

---

### Local mock server

The repository ships `dart run flutter_patcher:mock_server` for local end-to-end testing.

It serves a local `libapp.so` and `manifest.json` over HTTP for development only. It is never bundled into a release APK and should never be used in production.

```bash
dart run flutter_patcher:mock_server --dist dist
```

A typical workflow is to validate the full flow against the mock server, then plug your own backend in.

---

## Advanced configuration

Most projects don't need anything in this section.
Read on only when your project has an unusual startup, you want to optimize patch size, or you hit a Flutter version compatibility issue.

---

### Manual Android initialization

By default the plugin uses Android's auto-init mechanism to install the patch loader as early as possible.

If your app preheats `FlutterEngine` inside `Application.attachBaseContext`, auto-init may run *after* the engine has been created, which is too late for the patch to take effect. In that case, disable auto-init and call the entry point manually.

Remove the auto-init provider from `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<provider
    android:name="com.flutter_patcher.flutter_patcher.FlutterPatcherAutoInitProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.flutter_patcher.autoinit"
    tools:node="remove" />
```

Initialize manually inside your custom `Application`:

```kotlin
class MyApp : FlutterApplication() {
    override fun attachBaseContext(base: Context) {
        super.attachBaseContext(base)
        FlutterPatcherApplication.attachPatcher(base)
    }
}
```

Only do this when you know the project creates a `FlutterEngine` ahead of time.

---

### Flutter compatibility

`flutter_patcher` needs to influence Flutter Engine's loader during early Android startup.

The current `pubspec` allows Flutter `>=3.3.0`; the loader hook is verified on Flutter `3.19 ~ 3.38`. If a future Flutter release changes the loader internals, you may temporarily override the field name without upgrading the plugin:

```dart
await FlutterPatcher.init(
  loaderFieldCandidates: ['newFieldName', 'flutterLoader'],
);
```

After upgrading Flutter, check the `FlutterPatcher/Hook` tag in logcat to confirm injection succeeded.

---

## Limitations

### Android only

`flutter_patcher` only supports Android.

iOS does not allow shipping executable code dynamically. On Web, macOS, Windows and Linux every API is a no-op — patch logic never runs.

---

### APK or Flutter Engine upgrades invalidate old patches

Patches are tightly bound to the host APK `versionCode`.
After an APK upgrade, old patches are dropped automatically.

If you upgrade the Flutter Engine, Flutter SDK, or build configuration, regenerate the patch — do not reuse one built for an older toolchain.

---

### Reliance on Flutter internals

The plugin reaches into Flutter's Android embedding to influence how `libapp.so` is loaded during early startup.

When Flutter overhauls its loader architecture in a major release, the plugin may need to adapt.
After upgrading Flutter, validate on a real device that patches still load, roll back, and report diagnostics correctly.

---

### App-store policies and compliance

Dynamic executable-code delivery is restricted by some app stores and regulated verticals (finance, healthcare, government, apps for minors). The README TL;DR covers the basics; the plugin provides the technical capability — it doesn't substitute for your own compliance review.
